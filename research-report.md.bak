# Controller and Hand Gesture Recognition for Interactions in Virtual Reality Environments

**Goal**
- [ ] Real-time, online controller/hand gesture recognition with good accuracy
- [ ] Good generalization performance with few samples.
  - [ ] Validate: Cross-Validation
  - [ ] Validate: Boot-strapping
  - [ ] Validate: permutation hypothesis test
- [ ] Augmentations: Noise addition & Rotation/Translation transformation of the trajectory
- [ ] Indicate and predict in real-time, which gesture is being performed. Give indicator on the progress of the gesture and signal when gesture is completed
- [ ] Test on augmented (translated/rotated + noise data)

**SkTime Pre-Processing**
- [ ] TSInterpolator
- [ ] IntervalSegmenter

**Proposed**
- [ ] Unsupervised pre-training: Masked-autoencoders (generative model) or Barlow-Twins, 
- [ ] LSTM based, few layers, keras, onnx export

**TODO**
*Dataset*
- [ ] Subject info in controller dataset (tag + excel with recording times)
- [ ] Subject info in hand dataset (scripted from excel with recording times)
- [ ] detailed_index_meta for hand dataset
- [ ] Evaluation of right/left controller identification algorithm via VRGestures visualization

*Benchmark*
- [X] Write dataloader for hand gesture dataset
- [X] Write train/val/test split generator for hand dataset (stratify)
- [X] Extend controller dataloader to take into account left/right controller gestures
- [ ] Write test script that evaluates classifiers in the test set of the dataset
